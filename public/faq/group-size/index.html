  <meta property="og:description" content="Our flexibility is a core strength, as we design projects to scale based on your team size.
Minimum Size We can design effective teambuilding events for groups as small as 10 to 15 people. On Your Schedule projects can be done by any group size, but do not have a facilitator present. Maximum Size We regularly facilitate large-scale events and can accommodate dozens or even hundreds of people. We achieve this scale by using multiple stations, facilitators, and scalable projects. For especially large projects or workshop builds in an office, we would likely suggest shifts. Goal We ensure every participant feels engaged and can see the positive, measurable impact they are making. We think of projects in terms of the hours needed for project completion, and we plan for efficiency. There will always be enough to do at a Definitely Not a Robot project.">
