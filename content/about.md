When changing the whole world feels overwhelming, look for something you can improve around you. Our projects are not a one size fits all solution, and that’s not our goal. Local organizations, whether they are schools, nonprofits, or community spaces, have distinct needs. Our projects seek to address those needs by packaging them into events for groups or individuals who want to give back. 

We identify a community need, we build a project to address that need, and we engage people to get it done. From expertly guided projects out in the community to pre-packaged projects that can be done with a work team on their schedule, we’re sure to have something interesting, impactful, and local for you to work on. 

Some projects address an ongoing need, and others are one-time engagements to tackle a specific need area, but all of our projects come with instructors (or instructions) that make them accessible for everyone. Take a break from your digital life, use your human hands, and find out how you can help today.
