# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: November 13, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Definitely Not a Robot ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our website and services (the "Service").

### 1. Information We Collect

We only collect information that you voluntarily provide to us when you interact with our website, primarily through our contact form.

**Personal Information Collected via Contact Form:**

* **Contact Data:** Your name, email address, and phone number (if provided).

* **Purpose Data:** Information about your interest (e.g., "Teambuilding events," "Getting help with a project") and any text contained in the message field.

**Usage Data (Collected Automatically):**

When you access the Service, we may automatically collect certain information that your browser sends. This may include your computer’s Internet Protocol address (IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and other diagnostic data.


### 2. How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used solely for the purpose of operating our business and communicating with you.

* **To Respond to Inquiries:** To respond to your questions, comments, or requests submitted via the contact form.

* **To Coordinate Services:** To communicate with you regarding project proposals, scheduling, and service delivery.

* **For Internal Analytics:** To understand user interest and improve our service offerings (e.g., tracking the popularity of different "Interest" categories).

### 3. Tracking Technologies and Cookies

We do not currently use complex tracking technologies for external marketing purposes. Our website uses basic, necessary cookies solely to ensure the proper function of the website and to anonymously measure traffic patterns for internal improvement. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, though some parts of the website may not function correctly without them.

### 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may disclose your information only in the following limited circumstances:

* **Service Providers:** We may share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf, such as website hosting and email processing. These parties are contractually obligated to keep the information confidential.

* **Nonprofit Partners:** For the purpose of coordinating a teambuilding project, we may share relevant contact and project details with the specific nonprofit organization involved.

* **Legal Requirements:** If required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).

### 5. Data Retention

We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as for tax or accounting purposes).

### 6. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free, so please take special care in deciding what information you send to us.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
