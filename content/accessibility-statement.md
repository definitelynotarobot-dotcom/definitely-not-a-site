# Accessibility Statement

We are committed to making our website content and experience accessible and user-friendly for everyone. We strive to provide a positive experience for all visitors, regardless of ability or the adaptive technology being used.

### Conformance Status

The Definitely Not a Robot website strives to conform with **Level AA** of the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.

WCAG guidelines define three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. By meeting Level AA, we aim to ensure the site is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust across various devices and assistive technologies.

### Technical Information

The accessibility of this website relies on the following technologies to work with the combination of web browsers and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

We rely on the standard accessibility features of these technologies and the semantic structure provided by the Hugo framework to meet conformance standards.

### Known Limitations

We aim for fully accessible content; however, despite our best efforts, we recognize that there may be some known limitations. If you encounter an issue, please contact us immediately so we can address it.

* **Third-Party Content:** Some embedded third-party content (e.g., social media feeds or external booking widgets, if added in the future) may not fully conform to WCAG standards. We advocate for accessible tools whenever possible.

### Feedback and Support

We welcome your feedback on the accessibility of our website. If you encounter any barriers or have suggestions for improvement, please contact us:

* **E-mail:** [hello@definitelynotarobot.com](mailto:hello@definitelynotarobot.com)
