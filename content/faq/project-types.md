We offer four flexible project formats designed to fit your schedule and goals:

#### Project Formats

- **In the Community:** Hands-on, guided projects completed at local schools, parks, or nonprofits.
- **At Your Workplace:** We bring a custom project, materials, and facilitation directly to your office.
- **Make it, Take it:** Participants build a useful item and can choose to take it home or donate it.
- **On Your Schedule:** Project boxes dropped off for your team to complete on your timeline. Once completed, we arrange pick-up and distribution to our nonprofit partners.
