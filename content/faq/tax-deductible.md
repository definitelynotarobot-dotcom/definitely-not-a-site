Yes, but. 

At this time, Defnitely Not a Robot is a company, not a nonprofit. Watch this space. 😊

However, because we exist purely to facilitate teambuilding events which help our community, we have the ability to navigate payment in a way that allows for it to be written off. 

We do this through fiscal sponsorship with a partner nonprofit. We will walk you through the options to find what works best for your budget and reporting needs.

*Note: This process often costs a bit more due to administrative handling on all sides*
