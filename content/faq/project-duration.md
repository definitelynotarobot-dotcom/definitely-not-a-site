Our events are designed for flexible timing and high engagement. We build our events around the time needed to complete a given project. How that time can be split up is incredibly flexible. 

#### Duration

- Projects can engage participants for as little as **30 minutes** or run up to a **full-day** event, depending on the scope. We have also run workshops over multiple days for hundreds of participants. 

#### Efficiency

- We focus on structured activities that eliminate "standing around" time, ensuring your team's time is always used productively.
- The total effort is measured in hours, which we spread across the event format that makes the most sense for your team's schedule.
