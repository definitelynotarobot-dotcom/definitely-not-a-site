We highly recommend booking as far in advance as possible to ensure project alignment and secure your preferred date, especially during peak seasons (e.g., spring, summer, holiday season).

#### Ideal Booking Window

- We recommend reaching out **6-8 weeks** ahead of your desired event date.
- This window allows us to properly source and prepare all materials, and coordinate logistics with our nonprofit and community partners.

#### Last-Minute Events

- We can sometimes accommodate events with as little as **2 weeks** notice.
- Please note that project options may be limited for last-minute bookings.
