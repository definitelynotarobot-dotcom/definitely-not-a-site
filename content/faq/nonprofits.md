We exist to serve the needs of the community, and we welcome collaboration. Our goal is to take on projects that your organization has lacked the resources to complete. Many of these are completed at the offices of companies we work with, and delivered directly to you. We're also eager to look at other projects you may need help with.

#### Expert Assessment

- Our team is expert at addressing diverse needs, from facility repair to providing needed resources. Whether it's a single activity or addresses an ongoing need, we coordinate with donors and their volunteer teams to meet your criteria and scope. 

#### Direct Guidance

- If your need is better suited for a traditional volunteer effort outside our project-based model, we'll do everything we can to help. In other words, if a company we work with wants to take a volunteering shift that your organization is happy to facilitate, we will make the connection, and send them your way. 

- You can reach out directly via our [Contact Form](/contactus). We are eager to hear from you.
