We're flexible, and we can come to you

#### At Your Location

- We can set up our **in-office project types** at just about any workplace, including conference rooms, break areas, or even spacious office park parking lots. We will ask for room details and let you know what is possible. For On Your Schedule projects, we'd recommend a large open table, at a minimum. 

#### In the Community

- For projects we facilitate **in the community**, these will take place at our vetted partner locations (schools, community centers, or nonprofit partner offices).
