We make it easy to align your teambuilding efforts with a cause that matters to your team.

#### Our Selection Process

- **Needs-Based Matching:** Our projects are always generated from **real, locally requested needs** of our partner schools, nonprofits, and community spaces. We have robust connections in the Seattle and Portland metro areas, but have completed events in multiple states and countries. 
- **Cause Alignment:** You can specify your preferences (e.g., supporting education, animal welfare, or environmental cleanup). We then match you with a current project opportunity in our pipeline that aligns with those interests. 
- **Partnering with You:** If you already have a community partner in mind, we are happy to explore ways to translate their needs into an accessible, impactful project for your team.
